Digital Typewriter

This is an early version of the code, I still need to add comments and a few small features, but it does work.  To use a display other than the Waveshare 7in5, you will need a different file from Waveshare to replace epd7in5_V2.py and you'll need to adjust a few variables in the AlphaZero.py.  I'll make it more ubiquitus in the future.
